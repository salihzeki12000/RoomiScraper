A home should be safe, comfortable, well appointed, be a breeding ground of dreams and imaginations, and not be located in an unfavorable area. We’ve spent months crafting what we consider the optimal sanctuary to unwind, create memories, and to surmount our next endeavors in. \n\nJune Homes is a membership-based living brand that provides fully furnished properties in some of the most desirable areas. We don’t believe that you should only get a hotel experience while away, so we provide hotel-like services as well as amenities found in many luxury hotel brands in all of our properties. Membership is $99/month and includes utilities, Wi-Fi, Netflix and HBO, weekly cleaning, unlimited caffeine, fully equipped chef’s kitchens and unlimited home supplies from paper towel and even detergent if the home features a laundry room. No broker fees, sign-up costs, and questionable roommates all at an economical rate in your city’s hotspots.
